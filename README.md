# Facebook On Steroids

I love how [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) bring a whole new level of customizability, flexibility and shortcuts to Reddit. I haven't been able to find anything like that for Facebook, so this is my attempt to do something similar for facebook. 
For now it's Chrome extension, I might do a Firefox port in the future if the project goes as expected.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Commands bar
    - [ ] List friends, pages, groups and navigate to them
    - [ ] Access different pages (settings, privacy, messages, ..etc) quickly
    - [ ] Access custom shortcuts
- [ ] Custom shortcuts (key combinations) to groups, pages, profiles or anywhere on facebook.
- [ ] Vim-style keyboard navigation
- [ ] News feed filters
- [ ] News feed post classifier
- [ ] Custom news feeds: pick a number of groups, pages, friends. Display the latest posts from the picked places.

## Usage
For now you'll need to load the unpacked extension, at some point I'll release the .crx and maybe publish it on the web store.
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/d3vr/facebook-on-steroids.git`
2. Go to your [extension's page](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode.
3. Load unpacked and choose the `chrome` folder from the cloned repo.
