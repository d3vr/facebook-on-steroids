# Facebook On Steroids

I love how [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) bring a whole new level of customizability, flexibility and shortcuts to Reddit. I haven't been able to find anything like that for Facebook, so this is my attempt to do something similar for facebook. 
For now it's Chrome extension, I might do a Firefox port in the future if the project goes as expected.

## Installation
For now you'll need to load the unpacked extension, at some point I'll release the .crx and publish it on the Chrome Web Store.
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/d3vr/facebook-on-steroids.git`
2. Go to your **extension's page** (`chrome://extensions`) and enable *developer mode*.
3. Click on `Load unpacked` button and pick the `chrome` folder from the cloned repo.

## Features

### Commands Bar (CMDBar)
The Commands Bar, CMDBar for short, is a quick way to access different parts of facebook, navigate to pages/groups/friends, execute FOS commands and more.

The CMDBar uses a mode system to access different functionalities. Each mode has a symbol assigned to it, to access one mode: the first character you type into the CMDBar is the **character assigned to that mode**.

**Modes**:

| Trigger character  | Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `` ` `` (back tick) | Navigation | Shortcuts to different pages and parts on facebook |
| `!`  | Command | List of FOS commands |
| `@`  | Profile | List of all of your friends |
| `#`  | Hashtag | Search for posts using a given hashtag |
| `$`  | Search | Shortcut to facebook's search |
| `?`  | Help | Show CMDBar help |


### Custom Newsfeeds: `TODO`
### Posts classifier: `TODO`
